## 📚 About

This repo is my hands-on journey learning machine learning through Python. Rather than just copying code from tutorials, I worked through real datasets, made mistakes, fixed them, and learned **why** certain approaches work better than others. These Jupyter notebooks represent actual problem-solving with messy data, model selection decisions, and the kind of iterative experimentation that happens in real ML projects.

### 🎓 What I Learned

```python
skills = {
    "fundamentals": ["Linear Regression", "Classification", "Clustering"],
    "real_world": ["Missing Data", "Imbalanced Classes", "Feature Engineering"],
    "pipelines": ["Preprocessing", "Model Selection", "Hyperparameter Tuning"],
    "evaluation": ["ROC/AUC", "Confusion Matrices", "Silhouette Scores"],
    "tools": ["scikit-learn", "pandas", "NumPy", "matplotlib"]
}
```

## 💡 Key Takeaways

> **1. Start Simple, Then Optimize**  
> Linear models often perform better than you think. Add complexity only when needed.

> **2. Evaluation > Algorithm**  
> The right metric matters more than the fanciest model.

> **3. Pipelines Are Everything**  
> Production ML is about reproducibility and robustness, not just accuracy.

> **4. Real Data Is Messy**  
> Most of ML work is preprocessing. Get comfortable with it.

> **5. Experimentation Is Learning**  
> Every failed model teaches you something. Document the journey.

## 🎯 Why This Portfolio Matters

This isn't just homework I uploaded to check a box. This repo represents my **actual learning process** : the experiments, the "why did that work?" moments, and the mistakes I made along the way.
